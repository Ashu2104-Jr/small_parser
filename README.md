This project is a lightweight parser and compiler for a custom-designed programming language with a syntax close to low-level languages. It performs the following:

Lexical Analysis: Reads and tokenizes the input source code.
Syntax Checking: Validates the custom language syntax and identifies any errors.
Error Reporting: Displays clear error messages with line numbers and descriptions of what went wrong.
Code Generation: Converts error-free source code into equivalent low-level assembly-like instructions.
Execution: Produces the final output based on the generated low-level code.

Language Features
Looping Constructs: Supports loop structures for repeated execution.
Conditional Logic: Implements if, else, and related conditional expressions.
Function Calls: Enables definition and invocation of user-defined functions.
This tool is ideal for exploring how compilers work, experimenting with custom syntax design, and translating structured logic into low-level instruction sequences.
